Description: SMTP test server for development and CI/CD
 BadSMTP is a comprehensive SMTP test server written in Go for testing
 SMTP client implementations. It provides configurable behaviours,
 authentication mechanisms, error simulation, and message storage
 capabilities for development and CI/CD pipelines.
 .
 It does not send email to end recipients or act as a relay, so it's
 safe to deploy in CI and test environments.
 .
 Features:
  - Port-based behaviour system (delays, drops, etc.)
  - Multiple AUTH mechanisms (PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA256, XOAUTH2)
  - Error simulation with verb-prefixed patterns
  - Maildir-format message storage
  - TLS/STARTTLS support
  - Pluggable extension system
